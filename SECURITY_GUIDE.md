# Criarte Platform Security Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Criarte platform to protect against data leaks and hacker attacks.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Firebase Authentication** with secure token management
- **Role-based access control** (admin, user roles)
- **Session timeout** (30 minutes of inactivity)
- **Device fingerprinting** for trusted device detection
- **Secure logout** with complete session cleanup

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **XSS Prevention** with HTML sanitization
- **SQL Injection Protection** with pattern detection
- **File Upload Security** with type and content validation
- **Input validation** for all user inputs (email, text, numbers)

### 3. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
- **Request rate limiting** (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP)
- **Suspicious activity detection** with automated blocking
- **Pattern analysis** for multiple failed login attempts
- **File upload rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### 4. Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS
- **X-Frame-Options** to prevent clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options** to prevent MIME sniffing
- **Referrer Policy** for privacy protection
- **Permissions Policy** to control browser features

### 5. Database Security (Firestore)
- **Strict access rules** with user ownership validation
- **Admin-only collections** for sensitive data
- **Input validation** at database level
- **File size and type restrictions** (10MB limit)
- **Rate limiting** on database operations

### 6. File Upload Security
- **File type validation** (MIME type + extension)
- **File size limits** (10MB maximum)
- **Content scanning** for malicious patterns
- **Magic number verification** to prevent file spoofing
- **Secure file storage** with access controls

### 7. Security Monitoring
- **Real-time threat detection** with pattern analysis
- **Security event logging** to Firestore
- **Automated alerts** for suspicious activities
- **CSP violation reporting** for attack detection
- **Audit trail** for all security events

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Security settings in .env
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here_minimum_32_characters
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_here_minimum_32_characters
SESSION_TIMEOUT=1800000
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10
```

### Firestore Security Rules
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have elevated permissions
- File uploads restricted by type and size
- Rate limiting on write operations
- Input validation at database level

### Content Security Policy
```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://apis.google.com;
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
img-src 'self' data: https: blob:;
connect-src 'self' https://firestore.googleapis.com;
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never hardcode secrets** in source code
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server side
4. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing system details
5. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch security vulnerabilities
6. **Use HTTPS** in production environments

### For Administrators
1. **Monitor security logs** regularly
2. **Review user permissions** periodically
3. **Update security configurations** as needed
4. **Backup data** regularly with encryption
5. **Test security measures** with penetration testing

### For Users
1. **Use strong passwords** with special characters
2. **Enable two-factor authentication** when available
3. **Log out** when finished using the platform
4. **Report suspicious activity** immediately
5. **Keep browsers updated** for security patches

## Incident Response

### Automated Responses
- **Rate limiting** blocks excessive requests automatically
- **Suspicious activity detection** logs and alerts
- **Session timeout** prevents abandoned sessions
- **File validation** rejects malicious uploads

### Manual Response Procedures
1. **Investigate security alerts** in monitoring dashboard
2. **Block malicious IPs** if persistent attacks detected
3. **Reset user sessions** if compromise suspected
4. **Update security rules** based on new threats
5. **Document incidents** for future prevention

## Security Monitoring Dashboard

Access the security monitoring features through:
- `/admin/logs` - View all security events (admin only)
- Console logs for real-time monitoring
- Firestore `security_logs` collection for historical data

## Regular Security Tasks

### Daily
- [ ] Review security event logs
- [ ] Check for failed login patterns
- [ ] Monitor file upload activities

### Weekly
- [ ] Review user access permissions
- [ ] Update security configurations if needed
- [ ] Check for dependency vulnerabilities

### Monthly
- [ ] Conduct security assessment
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Test incident response procedures

## Contact Information

For security concerns or incidents:
- **Emergency**: Contact system administrator immediately
- **Non-urgent**: Create security incident ticket
- **Vulnerabilities**: Report through secure channel
